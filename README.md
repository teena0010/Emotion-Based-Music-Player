# Emotion-Based-Music-Player
🎵 Emotion-Based Music Player
An intelligent desktop application that detects your emotional state through facial expressions or voice input and plays music that matches your mood using YouTube. Built with Python, DeepFace, Google API, and a sleek Tkinter GUI.

📌 Features
- 🎭 Facial Emotion Detection: Captures your face via webcam and analyzes your emotion using DeepFace.
- 🗣 Voice Prompt Recognition: Listens to your voice and interprets the emotional tone of your spoken words.
- 🔍 Smart Music Mapping: Maps detected emotions to curated music keywords.
- ▶️ YouTube Music Playback: Automatically opens a matching music video on YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
- 🖼️ Dynamic GUI: Fullscreen Tkinter interface with responsive background and real-time webcam preview.

🚀 How It Works
- Launch the application.
- Choose between:
- Capture Emotion: Uses your webcam to detect your facial emotion.
- Voice Prompt: Uses your microphone to capture and interpret your spoken mood.
- The app maps the detected emotion to a music genre or mood.
- It fetches a relevant music video from YouTube and plays it in your browser.
